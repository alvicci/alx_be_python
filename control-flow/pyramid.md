## Challenge: Nested Loop Art!

Let’s create some text-based art using nested loops! Here’s the idea:

You’ll write a program that uses nested while loops to print a pyramid pattern of asterisks (\*).

### Steps:

1. Define the height of the pyramid (number of rows) as a variable, for example: rows = 5.
2. Use nested while loops to achieve the following:
   - The outer loop will control the number of rows.
   - The inner loop will print spaces and then asterisks in each row, creating a triangular shape.
3. Remember to adjust the number of spaces and asterisks printed within the inner loop based on the current row number to form the pyramid.

Example Output (for rows = 5):

```python
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```
